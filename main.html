        <h1>Brief History About Ongole</h1>
        <p>
          Ongole is a city in Prakasam district of the Indian state of Andhra
          Pradesh. It is the headquarters of Prakasam district and also the
          mandal headquarters of Ongole mandal in Ongole revenue division.
          Ongole cattle, an indigenous breed of oxen, derived its name from
          Ongole.
        </p>
        <p>
          The town's history dates from 231 BCE with the era of the Mauryas and
          Satavahanas who ruled most of what is now Andhra Pradesh. A few
          inscriptions dating to the Satavahana period have been found in the
          village China Ganjam, near Ongole. After the Satavahanas, this place
          came into the limelight again during the Kakatiya dynasty, when the
          nearby towns of Motupalli and Voda Revu served as major seaports.
          Ongole is also mentioned in the inscriptions of the Pallava rulers of
          the 3rd and 4th century A.D.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prakasam district was formerly called Ongole district and later,
          renamed to Prakasam in order to pay homage to the great patriot and
          ex-chief minister Tanguturi Prakasam Panthulu.Ongole district came
          into existence on 02-02-1970 with the carving out portions of Markapur
          revenue division from Kurnool, Ongole revenue division from Guntur and
          Kandukur revenue division from Nellore districts. It was renamed as
          Prakasam district in 1972 in memory of the eminent freedom fighter,
          later Chief Minister of the composite Madras State and the first Chief
          Minister of Andhra Pradesh State, late Andhra Kesari Sri Tanguturi
          Prakasam Panthulu, who was born at Vinodarayuni palem, a hamlet of
          Kanuparthi village of Naguluppala Padu Mandal of this district.
        </p>
        <p>
          The city was also ruled by Krishna Deva Raya. The last dynasty to rule
          the Ongole region before the British was the Mandapati dynasty
          (zamindars). According to the historical inscriptions available at Sri
          Raja Rajeswara Swami Temple complex in Ongole City was constructed by
          Cholas. Kaasi Visweswara Swami temple, Chenna Keswva Swami Temple and
          Veeranjaneya Swami temple were built in the early 17th century by King
          Vankayalapati mantri and Army Chief.
